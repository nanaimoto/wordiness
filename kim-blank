The world has only so much space—even the world of rhetoric. When you write, your job is to use that space carefully. Some quick tips: find the right word and use it; when in doubt, cut it out; edit your work like it was written by someone you don’t like; use an active rather than passive voice. The general principle is simple: if you’ve heard a phrase more than a couple of times, and it isn’t key wording, essential in carrying meaning, or definitive in some way, get rid of it.

You can get a good start by trying to avoid the following:

there is/are/was/were
it is/was
that is/are/was/were
which is/are/was/were
who is/are/was/were
You can also try to dump what I call "wazzle" (waffling and fuzzy) words, like "absolutely," "actually," "aspects," “basically," "definitely," "entirely," "extremely,""literally," "overall," "perfectly,"  "quite," "really," "situation," "truly," "ultimately," "virtually," and "very." "Could," "should," and "would" are also sometimes wazzlers.

Watch out, too, for overuse of "therefore," "indeed," "thus," "however," "moreover," "consequently," "over all," "nevertheless," "furthermore," and "hence." Save them for important turns or moments in your writing. When overused, they lose impact.

Here's an analogy. Think of your writing in the same way you think about all the stuff you own. Now think of having a yard sale. What you put into your yard sale are the useless things that have been taking up space and that you have been stumbling over. At first you feel a little remorse in seeing it all go, but then, with your new, uncluttered world, you feel clean and nimble. And to complete the analogy: if no one buys your yard sale stuff, you take it to the dump.

Before you go through the list, here is a challenge to put you in an anti-periphrastic mood. See how much of the following sentence, all forty-six words of it, that you can cut:

Due to the fact that access to internet resources are actually at the present time very easy to access in many places, the vast majority of users seek to have those kinds of devices that are most easy to carry around with them wherever they go.
